Mega Store Sales Analysis: From Volume to Margin
​Project Overview
​This project is a deep-dive diagnostic into the "Growth Paradox" of a global retail operation. While the Mega Store achieved £110M in gross sales, it currently operates at a Net Loss of -£1.09M. This analysis identifies critical "Profit Leaks" and provides a strategic recovery roadmap.
​The "Red Zone" (Current Problems)
​The Discount Trap: £11M was lost to discounts alone. Most sales occur at a 20% discount level, which is too aggressive and drives profit into the negative.
​High-Volume, High-Loss Products: The "Bikes" category accounts for 86.2% of sales but is the most unprofitable. Models like the Road-250 and Touring-1000 are currently "Loss Leaders."
​Geographic Deficit: All 6 regions are struggling, with Canada showing the worst performance at a -£1.2M profit gap.
​Retention Crisis: 60.93% (11.65K) of customers are "One-and-Done," meaning they only purchase once.
​Strategic Solutions (The Recovery Plan)
​Profit-Based Discounting: Reduce the average discount from 10% to 7%. This shift would save £3.3M, moving the store from a loss to a £2.21M profit without needing new customers.
​Portfolio Optimization: Delist products that cannot achieve a positive margin after a 10% discount.
​Customer Retention: Launch a "Second-Order" loyalty campaign to convert 15% of one-time buyers into repeat customers.
​Price Realignment: Implement a 2-5% price increase on top-tier bikes where unit prices are currently too close to standard costs.
​Tech Stack
​Power BI: Data modeling and visualization.
​Analysis: Sales trend analysis, Geospatial mapping, and Profitability diagnostics.
